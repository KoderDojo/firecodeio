# Firecode.io

[Firecode.io](https://www.firecode.io) is a very popular website for testing your programming skills using a variety of programming languages. It offers numerous programming challenges that test your knowledge of the fundamentals as well as algorithms and data structures.

I have been practicing with Firecode.io and other websites for quite some time. I am starting from scratch again, however, and will be adding the solutions to this repository in a variety of languages.
